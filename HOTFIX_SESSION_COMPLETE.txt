  WHAT HAPPENED
================================================================================

USER ISSUE:
  ImportError: cannot import name 'QAction' from 'PyQt6.QtWidgets'
  
  The freshly installed application crashed on launch with this error.

ROOT CAUSE:
  PyQt6 restructured its modules compared to PyQt5
  - QAction was in PyQt6.QtWidgets (old)
  - QAction is now in PyQt6.QtGui (new)
  
  The source code still had the old import location.

SOLUTION:
  Updated 1 import statement in faceless_video_app.py
  Moved QAction from QtWidgets import to QtGui import
  Rebuilt entire deployment chain

================================================================================
  WHAT WAS DONE
================================================================================

1. ✅ DIAGNOSED THE BUG
   - Located problematic import on line 9 of faceless_video_app.py
   - Identified PyQt6 API change as root cause
   - Verified fix approach would work

2. ✅ APPLIED THE FIX
   - Modified faceless_video_app.py lines 8-10
   - Moved QAction from QtWidgets import to QtGui import
   - 2 insertions, 1 deletion in source code

3. ✅ REBUILT EXECUTABLE
   - Command: pyinstaller --noconfirm build_minimal.spec
   - Time: ~60 seconds
   - Result: dist/faceless-youtube.exe (968.3 MB)

4. ✅ REBUILT INSTALLER
   - Command: iscc.exe /O"Output" faceless-youtube.iss
   - Time: 15 seconds
